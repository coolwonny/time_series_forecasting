## Background

Doing international business requires dealing with foreign currency transactions. We need to look for anything that can help us better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.
In this assignment, we will test the many time-series tools that we have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.
We're going to use the following tools mainly:

-[Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/coolwonny/time_series_forecasting/blob/master/time_series_analysis.ipynb)    
-[Linear Regression Modeling](https://github.com/coolwonny/time_series_forecasting/blob/master/regression_analysis.ipynb)
